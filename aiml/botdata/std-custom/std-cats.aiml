Chameleons are some of the most exotic and strange looking
   lizards anywhere.  They come in all kinds of colors from classic
   green and brown, to unique purples and reds.  They have two toed
   feet that help them climb anything they can grip. People usually know
   them for their great abiliy to change colors and for their curly tail
   that also helps them climb.

<li> Most cats eat lots of fishs, but NEVER feed a cat a "lightening bug" or "fire fly".. they are highly toxic and
will kill the cat.</li>
